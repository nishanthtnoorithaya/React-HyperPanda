This is a React Learning Course: 

1. Basic Understanding of Creating Elements in HTML,Through JS and in ReactJS.
2. Installing Parcel Bundler. (npm)
3. Creating ReactElements and Understanding of Package.json and Package.lock.json. 
4. What is npm and Node Modules.  
5. Installing React Module. 
6. Executing/Building Parcel in Local and Produnction Mode. (npx)  
7. Adding the Run Commands in Script Section in Package.json
8. Understanding of JSX ReactElements. 
9. Understanding of Babel 
10. React Components. (Functional (New/Modern Way) and Class Components(Older Way))
11. Dive More into React Functional Components.
12. Component Inside the Component/Nested Component (Component Composition). 
13. Injecting Plain JS Inside Component Using Curly Brackets { }
14. Creating Food Ordering Application using Dummy API or Statis JSON Data. (Creating Header,Body(Resto Cards), Footer Components) and Adding CSS. 
15. Understanding about Props (Its a Just Arguement to the Function (Passing Data)). 
16. Adding Static Data as a Strings (Names, Cusines etc) when Calling the Components. 
16. Creating JSON data and Extracting the Data using Props and Using Arguements from Components. 
17. Looping Using the Map Function. 
18. Importance of Key While Looping. 
19. Restructuring our app. Creating Src folder and Component Folders. (Adding all the components to components folder)
20. import/export from and to the Components and App. (default and Named Import/export). 
21. Keeping URL and Data in Seperate Folder called (Utils/common/config folders). 
22. React Hooks (UseState). (State Vairable) (Super Power Vairable). (This Syntax is actally a Array Destructing Syntax) (Use State returns a Array)
23. Make a The App dynamically render Data. When we click a button show filtered Data. 
24. Reconcilation Algorithm (React Fiber). This is Also Called as Virtual DOM. (This is a React Core Algorithm)
25. Virtual DOM is Finding the Difference between 2 Virtual DOM and Updating Real DOM. This is Why React is So Fast. 
26. Understanding of Monolith and Micro Service Architecture. 
27. Two Ways of fetching the Data from Backend. 1. (Load(webpage) - API Call - Render) 2. (Load(webpage) - Render(Skeleton UI) - API Call - Re-render) Way 2 is Preferred Good Way. 
28. UseEffect Hook (cb Function) -  Rendering Live Data using Fetch Aync Await Promise. 
29. Data Optional Chaining. 
30. Conditional Render (ternary Operator)
31. Shimmer UI (Creating a Skeleton UI before the API data Loads). 
32. Dive Deep into UseState (Why we need Usestate and Whats the Need) (Example of Login and Logout Toggle). 
33. Implemented the Search Functionality Filtering by name (UseState Concept). 
34. Make a Copy of Data using Another State Vairable to keep Original/Main Data Safe. (Avoid Breaking of UI when manipulating direct to Original/Main State Vairable Data).
35. Understanding of useEffect Logic when there is Dependency Array and Where there is no Dependency Array and When there is no Dependency Array. ( How useEffect will behaves). 
36. Important Points on UseState (Use this Hooks on the Top of the Components and Dont use inside the Conditional Statements, There wil be Inconstitency )
37. React Router: Install react router dom and Import some Components like  createBrowserRouter for Router Config, RouterProvider for Rendering the App and Outlet for adding the children Routers upon a Call like "/about", "/contact" and Link to Link onclick nav links like Anchor tag.  
39. Error page Handling using useRouteError Hook to Display More Info on the Error Page. 
40. Two types of Routing in Web Application (Client side - Just Loads the Page no N/W Calls are made), (Server side - Makes N/w Calls to server and Server Returns the Router Page). 
41. Concept of useParams Hook to Extract the Id from the data and Loads URL Dynamically also called as Dynamic Routing. 
42. Keeping the API Url Data in Utils Folder Seprating the API in Different Folder. 
43. Class Based Component: Basically How component works Constructor,render,Calls API in Mounting Stage. 
Concept of Child Component and Parent Component. 
44. Creating Hooks as in Fn Component state Vairables (this.state and this.SetState) and Useffect like fn in class component (directly in componentDidMount method).  
45. Component Life Cycle (Mounting/Loading Component (componentDidMount) (Calling API), Updating Component (componentDidUpdate) Updating the Component using state Vairable, Removing/Leaving from Component (componentWillUnmount))
46. Dive deep into each of the Lifecycle. 
47. Creating Custom Hooks (useRestocards, useOnlineStatus). 
48. Develop a New Feature Online and Offline using Window Fn Addeventlistener 
49. Concept of Chunking/Dynamicsplitting,Lazyloading.: Basically splitting up a Large code into a Small bundles. (Makemytrip website Example)
50. Lazylaoding: Loading the Grocery code On the click only not on load.  
60.
